I am signing up for Repit's 100 days of python challenge! 
I will make sure to spend some time everday coding along, 
for a minimum of 10 min a day.I'll be using Replit, an amazing 
online IDE so I can do this from my phone or wherever I happen to be. 
No excuses for not coding fron the middle of a field.""")
